# Data-Analysis-using-R

In this case study, I will be taking on the challenge of refining the Cyclists Companyâ€™s raw data. My mission is
to transform this unpolished data into a valuable asset by leveraging the capabilities of both R programming
and its visualising tool. Once the data has undergone thorough cleansing and wrangling, I will analyze the data
to unearth actionable insights. These insights will be instrumental in guiding the Cyclists Company toward
boosting their membership and enhancing their product offerings.
